  the city house, also known as the <br>thornburgh finkenbiner house resides at 
  3534 washington avenue in the grand<br> center neighborhood.
the building was built in 1871 and is <br>a great example of the second imperial style 
very prominent in st louis especially in<br> more wealthy areas. the limestone tiles cladding 
the front of the building were also a <br>sign of wealth at the time of construction.
  the building was built in 1871 for <br>john mcc. thornburgh. his son josiah, who was a clerk 
  in the federal appeals courts also resided<br> in the building. in the 1880s, josiah h. lucas and 
  robert murray resided in the building.<br>
  from around 1890 to the early 1910s,<br> john s. finkenbiner, who was the general manager <br>
  of singer manufacturing co, lived in the house with his family.
  the building is one of the oldest surviving<br> buildings in the grand center neighborhood.
  from what i can tell, the building was abandoned <br> and renovated at some point in 2023
  and is now a vacation home, which absolutely sucks.
